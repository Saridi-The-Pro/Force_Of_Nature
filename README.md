# Coding_Testing_Area
This is the designated area where we can thoroughly test our projects before their public release. By conducting these tests, we can identify any issues or areas for improvement, ensuring that our programs are polished and ready for play by other users.

# IMPORTANT NOTE!!
SOME OF THESE PROGRAMS ARE STILL UNOFFICIAL OR IN PROTOTYPE STAGES. IF YOU ENCOUNTER ANY BUGS WHILE USING THE PROGRAM, FEEL FREE TO CONTACT ME VIA DIRECT MESSAGE ON INSTAGRAM, TALK TO ME FACE-TO-FACE, OR USE ANY OTHER PLATFORM THROUGH WHICH I CAN REACH YOU.
